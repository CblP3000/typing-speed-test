A Piece of String A piece of string walks into a bar and tries to order a drink. The bartender says, “Sorry, we don’t serve strings here.” The string walks back outside, messes up its hair, ties itself into a bow, and walks back in. The bartender says, “Hey! Aren’t you the string that was just in here?” The string replies, “No, I’m a frayed knot.”
