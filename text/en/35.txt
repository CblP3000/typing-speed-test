Complimentary Peanuts A guy walks into a bar and sits down. After a few seconds, he hears a high-pitched voice say, “I like your shirt!” The guy looks around, but there’s no one else at the bar besides him and the bartender. Again, he hears the voice say, “You have beautiful eyes!” The guy asks the bartender, “Is that you?” The bartender replies, “No, it’s the peanuts. They’re complimentary.”
