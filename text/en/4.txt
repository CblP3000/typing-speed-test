European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2 The world's leading expert on European wasps walks into a record shop. He asks the assistant, “Do you have European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2? I believe it was released this week.” The assistant checks the computer and then says, “Certainly. Would you like to listen before you buy it?” The expert replies, “Of course!” The assistant hands him a pair of earphones and puts the record on a turntable near the counter, and turns it on. The expert listens for a few moments and says to the assistant, “I'm terribly sorry, but I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and this is not accurate at all. I don't recognize any of those sounds. Are you sure this is the correct recording?” The assistant checks the turntable. “Yes, sir,” he says. “This is the European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2. Let me skip ahead to the second track.” Again the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant, “This just can't be right! I've been an expert in this field for 43 years and I still don't recognize any of these sounds.” The assistant apologizes and lifts the needle to the next track. As soon as the track starts playing, the expert throws off the headphones. “This is outrageous false advertising! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and no European wasp has ever made a sound like the ones on this record!” The manager of the shop overhears the commotion and walks over. “What seems to be the problem, sir?” The expert turns to him, red-faced and fuming. “This is an outrage! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps. Nobody knows more about them than I do. There is no way in hell that the sounds on that record were made by European wasps!” The manager glances down and notices the problem instantly. “I'm terribly sorry, sir. It appears we've been playing you the bee side.”
