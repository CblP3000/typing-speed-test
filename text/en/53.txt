The Genie A guy walks into a bar with a genie’s lamp and a briefcase. He sits down and puts the lamp and the briefcase up on the bar. The bartender pours the guy a drink and then asks, “What’s in the briefcase?” The guy opens it up to reveal a tiny man playing a piano. The bartender asks, “Where’d you get that?” The guy points at the lamp and replies, “This genie granted me a wish. Do you want to try?” The bartender laughs and says, “Sure! Who wouldn’t?” The guy rubs the lamp and out pops a genie. “What is your wish?” The genie asks. The bartender says, “Give me a million bucks!” The genie claps his hands together and the bar fills with a million ducks. The bartender looks around at his bar in disgust and says, “I think your genie has a hearing problem.” The guy rolls his eyes. “Did you think I wanted a 12-inch pianist?”
