The Boy & the Barber A young boy walks into a barber shop. The barber whispers to his customer, “This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch this.” He holds a dollar in one hand and two quarters in the other, and asks the boy, “Which one do you want?” The boy takes the quarters and leaves. “Told you,” says the barber. “That kid never learns.” Later, the customer sees the boy eating ice cream. “Why do you always take the quarters instead of the dollar?” The kid smiles: “Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over.”
