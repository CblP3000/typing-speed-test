Fast Snail A snail goes to buy a car. The salesman is surprised when the snail picks out a fast, expensive sports car. He’s even more surprised when the snail requires that a big red “S” be painted on both sides. “Why would you want such a thing?” asked the salesman. The snail replied, “I want people to say, ‘Look at that S car go!’”
