Hungry Duck A duck walks into a store and asks the shopkeeper, “Got any bread?” The shopkeeper says no, and the duck leaves. The next day, the duck comes back and asks the shopkeeper, “Got any bread?” Again, the shopkeeper politely says no, and the duck leaves. On the third day, the duck comes back and asks, “Got any bread?” This time, the shopkeeper gets upset and shouts, “If you ask if we have bread one more time, I’m going to nail your feet to the floor!” The duck says sorry and leaves. The next day, the duck comes back. It asks, “Got any nails?” Surprised by the new question, the shopkeeper replies, “No.” The duck pauses for a second and then asks, “In that case, got any bread?”
