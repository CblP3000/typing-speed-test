Martini-Drinking Gorilla A gorilla walks into a bar and orders a martini. The bartender makes the drink, amazed that a gorilla came in. The gorilla gives the bartender $2 and the bartender gives back $1 in change. The bartender says, “I don’t get many gorillas in here, you know.” The gorilla replies, “For $19 a martini, I can see why!”
