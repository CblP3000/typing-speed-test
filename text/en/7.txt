The Smartest Man Alive A small plane is flying from Dallas to Denver when the engine sputters and dies. The pilot runs out of the cockpit, grabs a parachute, opens the door, then says, “Sorry, there are only three parachutes left,” and jumps out. This leaves 4 passengers: a boy scout, a college professor, a priest, and a doctor. The doctor says, “Guys, I need to be saved. I heal people and am a valuable resource to the human population.” He grabs a parachute and jumps out. The professor says, “Well, I've won the Nobel Peace Prize and spoken to the leaders of the free world. The President of the United States has called me the smartest man alive. It is obvious I need to be saved.” He grabs a parachute and jumps out, leaving the priest and the boy scout… but only one parachute. The priest smiles sadly at the boy and says, “Son, I've lived a long and fruitful life. You are young and have the rest of your life in front of you. Take the last parachute.” The scout replies, “It's okay, Father. The smartest man alive just jumped out of the plane with my knapsack.”
