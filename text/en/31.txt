New Dentures A man caught a really bad flu. As he was recovering, his friend came over to bring him some soup to help him feel better. As soon as the friend walked through the door, the man coughed so violently, his false teeth shot across the room and smashed to pieces against the wall. “Oh, dear,” he said, “what am I going to do? I can’t afford a new set.” His friend patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry. I’ll get a pair from my brother for you.” The man thanked him, and the friend said goodbye. The next day, the friend came back with a bright and shiny set of teeth, which fit the man perfectly. “This is wonderful,” said the man. “Your brother must be a very good dentist.” The friend shook his head. “Oh, he’s not a dentist. He’s an undertaker.”
