12 Shots A guy walks into a bar and orders 12 shots. Before the bartender even returns with the check, the man has slammed back half of them and shows no signs of slowing down. As the guy finishes his final shot, the bartender asks, “Why are you drinking so fast?” The guy wipes his mouth and replies, “You would be drinking fast, too, if you had what I had.” The bartender asks, “What do you have?” The guy says, “75 cents,” and runs out the door.
