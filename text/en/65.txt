One-Eyed Captain An old sea captain with a peg leg, hook hand, and eye patch walks into a bar. The bartender looks him up and down and says, “How’d you get that peg leg?” The captain replies, “A whale bit my leg off.” The bartender nods. “And how did you get that hook?” The captain replies, “A scurvy scalawag cut my hand off with a sword.” Impressed, the bartender says, “Wow! You’ve lived such an exciting life! How did you get that eye patch?” The captain answers, “A seagull pooped right in my eye.” The bartender frowns. “You lost your eye from seagull poop?” The captain nods and says, “Aye, it was my first day with the new hook.”
