Catch of the Day A young man passing a bar sees an old woman fishing with a stick and a string in a puddle by the sidewalk. “She must be a poor old fool,” he thinks to himself, and out of the kindness of his heart, invites the woman in for a drink. After he’s paid for their round and the two are sitting quietly, enjoying their drinks, he asks her, “So how many have you caught today?” The old woman grins, takes a big sip of her drink, and replies, “You’re the eighth.”
