Smart Dog A man went to visit a friend and was amazed to find him playing chess with his dog. The man watched his friend and the dog play for a while before saying, “I can hardly believe my eyes! That’s the smartest dog I’ve ever seen.” The friend shook his head and said, “Nah, he’s not so smart. I’ve beaten him three games out of five.”
