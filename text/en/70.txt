Fresh Coffee A man goes into a restaurant and orders a cup of coffee. The waiter brings it out to him. The man takes a sip and immediately spits it out. He turns to the waiter and says, “Waiter! What is the meaning of this? This coffee tastes like mud!” The waiter, looking surprised, turns to the man and says, “But, sir, you ordered fresh ground!”
