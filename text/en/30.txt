Sick in Church A child was in church with their mother when they started to feel sick. “Can we leave now?” They asked. “No,” their mother said. “But I’m going to throw up,” the child insisted. “If you have to, go throw up outside behind a bush.” The child left and returned a few moments later. “How did you go outside so fast?” their mother asked. “I didn’t have to go outside,” the child said. “There’s a box in the lobby that says ‘For the Sick.’”
