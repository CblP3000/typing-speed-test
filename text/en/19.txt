The Patient Truck Driver A truck driver is starving and stops at a biker bar to eat. He goes inside, sits down at the bar, and orders a beer and some food. Right after he’s served, a biker gang enters the bar, eager for a fight. One walks up to the trucker, and slaps his hat off. The trucker takes a sip of beer. Another biker swats his food off the bar. The trucker takes another sip of beer. So a third biker grabs the beer and pours it over the trucker’s head. The trucker gets up, pays the bill, and leaves. The biker leader says, “That trucker sure wasn’t much of a fighter.” The bartender glances out the window and says, “He’s not much of a driver either. He just smashed his truck into a row of motorcycles.”
