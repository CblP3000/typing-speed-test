A Long Sermon A pastor moved to a new church and decided to impress the congregation with a long sermon. Just when he reached the middle, a man stood up and walked out without a word. After the service, a woman approached the pastor, “I’m so sorry my husband walked out of your sermon,” she said. The pastor smiled at her and replied, “ Well, it did confuse me. I worked very hard on that sermon, and it felt a little disrespectful.” The woman shook her head emphatically. “He meant no disrespect, but he’s been sleepwalking ever since he was a child.”
