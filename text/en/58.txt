1-Armed Man A man lost one of his arms in an accident. One day, he felt terribly depressed and decided to end his life. He went to the top of a building to jump off. As he stood on the ledge looking down, he saw this man skipping along, whistling and kicking up his heels. When he looked closer, he saw that this man didn't have any arms. He said to himself, “What am I doing up here feeling sorry for myself? I still have one good arm. There goes a man with no arms skipping down the sidewalk, happy and going on with his life.” The 1-armed man hurried down to the street and caught up to the man with no arms. “Man, I am so glad I saw you. I recently lost one of my arms. I felt ugly and useless, and I was going to kill myself. But then I saw you and knew if you could go one with no arms, I could definitely make it with only 1 arm. Thank you. You saved my life.” The man with no arms began dancing and kicking up his heels again. The one-armed man asked, “What’s your secret to staying happy all the time?” The armless man replied, “I'm NOT happy… my butt itches like crazy.”
