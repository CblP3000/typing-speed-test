The Meaning of Definitely A kindergarten teacher is trying to explain to her class the definition of the word “definitely.” To make sure the students have a good understanding of the word, she asks them to use it in a sentence. A student in the front raises her hand and says, “The sky is definitely blue.” The teacher says, “Well, that isn't entirely correct because sometimes it's gray and cloudy.” Another student says, “Grass is definitely green.” The teacher again replies, “If grass doesn't get enough water, it turns brown, so that isn't really correct either.” Finally, Billy raises his hand and asks the teacher, “Do farts have lumps?” The teacher looks at Billy and says, “That isn't really a question you want to ask in class discussion, but… no.” Billy replies, “Then, I definitely just pooped my pants.”
