Favorite Patients Five surgeons were talking about their favorite patients. The first surgeon says, “Accountants are the best to operate on because when you open them up, everything on the inside is numbered.” The second surgeon says, “Nah, librarians are the best. Everything inside them is in alphabetical order.” The third surgeon says, “You have to operate on electricians. Everything inside them is color coded!” The fourth surgeon smirks and says, “I prefer lawyers. They're heartless, spineless, and gutless, and their heads and butts are interchangeable.” After quietly listening to the entire conversation, the fifth surgeon pipes up and says, “I like engineers because they always understand when you have a few parts left over at the end.”
