An Elephant in a Movie Theater One day, a man with an elephant walks into a movie theater. “I’m afraid I can’t let your elephant in here, sir,” the manager says. “Oh, I assure you, he’s very well behaved,” the man says. “All right then,” the manager says. “If you’re sure.” The man said, “Trust me. He’ll be perfectly quiet.” After the movie, the manager goes up to the man and the elephant and says, “I’m very surprised! Your elephant was very well behaved. He even seemed to enjoy the movie!” The man shot a look at the elephant and said, “Yeah, I was surprised, too. He hated the book.”
