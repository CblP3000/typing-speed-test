The Cure A lady goes to her doctor for a checkup. The doctor asks her if she is having any problems. “Yes, doctor,” she says. “I have to fart a lot. Fortunately, no one can hear them or smell them. In fact, I’ve farted twice since you came in and they were silent and odorless.” The doctor nods and says, “I can treat this problem with an over-the-counter medication, a prescription, and a referral. The medication will help your body produce less gas. The prescription will help you recover your sense of smell. I’m giving you a referral to an audiologist to see if they can help you hear better.”
