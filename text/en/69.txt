Rude Bus Driver A woman holding a baby gets onto a bus. The driver takes one look at them and says, “Wow, that’s an ugly baby!” The woman is outraged, but says nothing. As she walks back to an open seat, another passenger sees that she is upset, and asks why. She says, “That bus driver was so rude and insulting!” The passenger says, “Why, you march right back up there and give that rude driver a piece of your mind! Here, I’ll hold your monkey.”
