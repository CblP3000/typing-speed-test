The Pirate & the Wheel A pirate walks into a bar with a small ship’s wheel on the front of his pants. A consummate professional, the bartender tries to ignore it. “What’ll you have?” he asks. “Whiskey,” the pirate replies. The bartender brings him the whiskey and he drinks it down. “Another,” the pirate says, shifting uncomfortable. “Sure thing,” the bartender says and pours him another whiskey. The pirate snatches it up and drinks it right down. By this time, the pirate is starting to get a little wobbly. When he orders a third whiskey, the bartender says, “I’ll get it for you if you answer me one thing.” “What’s that?” the pirate says. “Why on earth do you have a ship’s wheel on your pants?” The pirate shakes his head. “I don’t know, but it’s driving me nuts.”
