Late for School A child was late to school for the first time. The teacher asked him if anything was wrong. “No,” the child said, “I wanted to go fishing, but my dad told me I needed to go to school.” The teacher was impressed. “And did your father explain why it was important to go to school instead of going fishing?” The child nodded solemnly and said, “He said it was because there’s not enough bait for both of us.”
