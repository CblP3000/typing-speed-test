Quite Smoking There’s this man who always smokes two cigarettes at the same time. Eventually, one of his friends asks, “What's with the two cigarettes?” The man replies, “My brother is in prison, and he told me to smoke a cigarette for him every time I smoke one for myself.” A few months later, his friend sees the man again and he’s smoking only one cigarette instead of two. Surprised, the friend asks, “Has your brother been freed from prison?” The man shakes his head sadly and says, “No, I just quit smoking.”
