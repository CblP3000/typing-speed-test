New Fathers Four men are in the hospital waiting room because their wives are having babies. A nurse goes up to the first man and says, “Congratulations! You're the father of twins.” The man says, “That's odd. I work for the Minnesota Twins!” Another nurse goes up to the second man and says, “Congratulations! You're the father of triplets!” The second man laughs and says, “That's weird. I work for the 3M company!” A third nurse goes up the third man and says, “Congratulations! You're the father of quadruplets!” He says, “That's strange. I work for the Four Seasons hotel!” As soon as he says that, the last man starts groaning and banging his head against the wall. “What’s wrong?” the others ask. The man says, “I work for 7Up.”
