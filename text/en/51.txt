Persistent Drunk A drunk man walks into a bar and tries to order a drink. The bartender tells the man he can’t serve him and throws him out. A few minutes later, the drunk man tries to come back in. Again, the bartender throws him out. When the man comes in for a third time, the bartender shouts, “We can’t serve you, please leave!” The drunk man replies, “How many bars do you work at?!”
