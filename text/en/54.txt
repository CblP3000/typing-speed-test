Smart Drinking A guy walks into a bar and asks for 10 shots of the establishment’s finest single malt scotch. The bartender sets him up, and the guy takes the first shot in the row and pours it on the floor. He then takes the last shot in the row and does the same. The bartender asks, “What did you do that for?” The guy replies, “Well, the first shot always tastes like crap, and the last one always makes me sick!”
