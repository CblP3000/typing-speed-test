Sex Education A little girl asks her father, “What is sex?” The father thinks, This is the day I have to explain the birds and the bees to my little princess. He sits her down and explains sex, including sexual intercourse, conception, sperm, eggs, ovulation, menstruation, etc. When he’s done, his little girl looks up at him and asks, “Daddy, what’s a couple mean?” He explains that a couple is when two people are romantically involved and that it usually involves them having sex. When he’s done, he asks the little girl, “Why do you want to know about a couple and sex?” Looking confused, she says, “Mommy said lunch will be ready in a couple of secs.”
