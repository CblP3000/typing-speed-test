A Lab & a Chihuahua Two friends are walking their dogs together. One has a big black lab, while the other has a minuscule chihuahua. They pass a bar, and the lab owner says, “Let's get a drink.” The chihuahua walker says, “That would be great, but we can't take our dogs in there.” The first responds, “Watch me.” The lab owner strolls in with her dog and orders a drink. The bartender says, “Sorry, you can't bring your dog in here.” Feigning offense, the woman says, “He's my seeing eye dog!” The bartender quickly apologizes and serves her the drink. The other woman follows, her chihuahua in tow, and orders a drink as well. Again, the bartender says, “No dogs allowed in the bar.” The second woman replied, “He's my seeing-eye dog.” The bartender makes a face. “A chihuahua? Give me a break.” Without missing a beat, the woman replies, “They gave me a chihuahua?!”
