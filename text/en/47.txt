Choose Your Own Hell A guy dies and is sent to hell. Satan shows him the doors to three rooms, and says, “Choose one of these doors to decide where you will spend eternity.” In the first room, a group of people stands in dirt up to their necks. The guy says, “No, let me see the next room.” In the second room, people are standing in dirt up to their noses. The guy shakes his head and says, “Nah, not this one either.” Then, Satan opens the third door to reveal a group of people standing with dirt up to their knees, drinking coffee and eating pastries. The guy perks up and says, “I pick this room.” He wades in and starts pouring a cup of coffee. Satan turns to leave and then says, “OK, coffee break’s over. Everyone, back on your heads!”
