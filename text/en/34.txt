The Man & the Snail A guy is watching his favorite TV show when he hears a knock at the door. Swearing to himself, he gets up and answers the door. There’s a snail on the porch looking up at him expectantly. The guy picks up the snail and throws it as far as he can. Then he slams the door and goes back to watching TV. Three years later, the guy is watching TV again when there’s a knock on the door. He opens it and sees the same snail. The snail looks up at him and says, “What the hell was that all about?”
