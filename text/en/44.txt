3 Wishes Three friends are stranded on a desert island. After a few years, they find a magic lantern buried in the sand. When they rub the lamp, a genie pops out and tells them he will grant them each one wish. The first guy steps up and says, “I wish I was back at home.” Poof! He disappears. The second guy steps up. “I wish I was at home, too.” Poof! He disappears. The third guy looks around and sighs sadly. Then he says, “I’m lonely. I wish my friends were here.”
