3 Couples A young couple, a middle-aged couple, and an elderly couple all want to get married at the same church. They meet with the priest to discuss when they can get married. The priest says, “If you wish to get married in my church, you must all go one month without having sex.” The couples nod and file out of the priest’s office. One month later, they return to the church. The priest asks the elderly couple, “Were you able to go the whole month without having sex?” The elderly couple smiles and says, “Yes, we have, it was easy.” The priest turns to the middle-aged couple. “How about you?” he asks. The middle-aged couple nods. “It was hard, but we made the whole month without having sex.” Finally, the priest turns to the young couple. “And how about you two?” The couple shifts in their seats. The boyfriend looks up shamefully and says, “No, we couldn’t make it the whole month without having sex.” The priest frowns and says, “Tell me why.” The boyfriend looks down at the ground. “Well, my girlfriend had a can of corn in her hand, and she accidentally dropped it. When she bent over to pick it up, I just couldn’t help myself.” The priest shakes his head sorrowfully and says, “I’m sorry, but you’re  not welcome in my church.” The boyfriend shrugs. “That’s all right, we can’t go back to the grocery store either.”
