3 Nurses in Heaven Three nurses died and went to heaven, where they were met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter. To the first, he asked, “What did you do on Earth and why should you go to heaven?” “I was a nurse in an inner-city hospital,” she replied. “Very noble,” said St. Peter. “You may enter.” To the next, he asked the same question: “So what did you do on Earth?” “I was a nurse at a missionary hospital in Africa,” she replied. “How touching,” said St. Peter. “You, too, may enter.” He then came to the last nurse, to whom he asked, “So, what did you do back on Earth?” After some hesitation, she explained, “I was just a nurse at an HMO.” St. Peter pondered this for a moment, and then said, “Okay, you may enter also.” “Whew!” said the nurse. “For a moment there, I thought you weren’t going to let me in.” “Oh, you can come in,” said St. Peter, “but you can only stay for three days.”
