Bar with Hanging Meat A guy walks into a bar and sees three pieces of meat hanging from the ceiling. He asks the bartender, “What’s up with the meat?” The bartender explains, “If you can jump up and hit one, you drink for free tonight. If you miss, you have to buy everyone else a drink. You want to try?” The guy says, “No thanks, the steaks are too high.”
