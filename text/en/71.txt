A Trip to the Vet A man takes his sick Chihuahua to the veterinarian. They’re immediately taken back to a room. First, a Labrador walks in, sniffs the Chihuahua for 10 minutes, and leaves. Next, a cat comes in, stares at the Chihuahua for 10 minutes, and leaves. Finally, the doctor comes in, prescribes some medicine, and hands the man a $250 bill. “This must be a mistake,” the man says. “I’ve been here only 20 minutes!” The vet says, “No mistake. It’s $100 for the lab test, $100 for the cat scan and $50 for the medicine.”
